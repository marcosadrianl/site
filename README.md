Hi! thanks for reading this doc! 

I am Marcos, and want to be part of this world of developers. My university teaches me "How to Create well structured software" but now i'm interted in 
web developing. So, i'm currently taking a lot of courses! 

- Online courses i'm in: [FullStackOpen](http://fullstackopen.com) learning ReactJS.
- Also taking a presencial course at the UMUPLA - CFP 413 center (Argentina) [UMUPLA - CFP 413](https://umupla.wordpress.com/cfp-no-413/)

So, the idea is not original for me, but i am aplying everything i learn here. every friday i'll make changes here and there, so this web is far from his final
form! (who knows if i'll write this in react soon?? cross my fingers!)

Feel free to copy the repo, aske me question or just say hi! (if you notice any issue, or copyright violation, please message me)


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
